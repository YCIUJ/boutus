            Welcome to our community website, our goal is to improve intergenerational Relationships by documenting a series of student interview with older people. We believe strongly that by creating a space where students and seniors can connect and share their stories we can help  overcome the generation gap and get a greater sense of understanding and respect between the people of different ages and generations.

            Together we have alle designed this very website as a platform for students to interview older people and share their experiences and stories with a bigger audience. By showcasing the wisdom and life experiences of seniors we can challenge stereotypes and build a more inclusive society we hope that you take part in this initiative and became a part of our community. It does not matter whether you are a student who wants to take part in an interview an older person who wants to share their story, or a community member who wants to support out mission, because together we can build a better and brighter society.
